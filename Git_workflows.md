# Workflow

* A centralized sorkflow involves working on a single branch
* In a feature branch workflow, work of the project is done on feture/topic branches and then merged into longer running branches
* In a forking workflow, work is added upstream using pull requests from the forked repository
* Gitflow workflows enable a continous train of project releases using multiple types of branches
